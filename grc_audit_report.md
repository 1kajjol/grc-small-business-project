# GRC Analysis: Mobile Repair Shop Audit

This project is based on a small business GRC audit I conducted at my friendâ€™s phone repair store. She operates a few kiosks and a storefront, but lacks a formal system for managing risks.

## What I Observed
- No proper inventory or quality control system.
- Customer complaints due to poor screen quality after repairs.
- No documentation or security measures for customer devices.

## What I Did
- Created a basic risk register using LibreOffice.
- Identified common operational, financial, and reputational risks.
- Categorized each risk by impact, likelihood, and mitigation status.

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu OS
- LibreOffice Calc
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Why This Matters
This GRC mini audit helped me understand how risk frameworks apply in even the smallest businesses. It reflects my ability to identify and mitigate real-world operational threats.
